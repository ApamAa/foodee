Its a darker richer espresso than the one used at Faubourg. The almond croissant had plenty of icing sugar -- warning: dont eat on a date, you'll make a mess.",

I stood up to make sure that it doesn't come towards us, but then it kept on going towards us. There was a staff member trying to catch the mouse. However, this is not how the situation should have been handled. I have been working in the food industry, and I know there must be proper pest control in place to prevent such incidences. Now, it makes me wonder of the sanitary conditions on their kitchen! We loved Thierry; however, this single incident made us determined to not visit their place anymore.",
